# Research Question
Is there a relationship between access to rail transit, walkability, and wealth in large Southern cities (Atlanta, Dallas, DC, Houston, Miami)?

# Abstract
In this study, we investigate areas with easy access to rail transit in major cities in the American South to understand what demographics are served by rail transit. In particular, we study the relationship between easily accessible rail transit and the median owner-occupied housing unit value. We first run regressions at the census block group level on average walking distance to the nearest rail transit station median home value while controlling for Walk Score®. To account for spatial clustering, we run a Moran’s I and then a spatially lagged model to account for autocorrelation between our variables. We find that the results provide insight into the usage patterns and demographics of the areas surrounding rail transit stations in Southern cities. Further research could prove valuable in identifying regions that need more housing, improved rail transit service, or local infrastructure upgrades like sidewalks, crosswalks, and bike lanes.
